<h2>Java Script</h2>
<p>Jave script, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed,
    prototype-based, multi-paradigm and interpreted programming language. Alongside 
    HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web
    content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provids online
    programs, including vidio games. the majority of websites employ it, and all mordern
    web browers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a bulit-in JavaScript
    engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of
    JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript sprcification, with some engines not supporting
    the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
